##AUTHOR:
Alexa Villaume, for the SAGES group based at UC Santa Cruz

##PURPOSE:
This is intended to be a set of tools that will make doing photometry both easier and more uniform across the SAGES group. These are the following
goals:
* Make DEIMOS mask design easier and more uniform
* Get the best photometry that we can from our Subaru images. I will be following the methods of Whitaker et al. (2011)
* Mitigate the complications and annoyances that come with working with multiple different catalogs from different sources including archival
  catalogs 
##STATUS:
Still in progress
