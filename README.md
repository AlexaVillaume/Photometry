PURPOSE:
To develop a photometry pipeline

STATUS:
The initial framework and some basic functions are in place. Right now, it's only built for when we already have full photometry catalogs and we need to make cuts for a GC candidate list. There are still some incomplete things but the basic idea is down. Please let me know if anything is annoying or incomplete.
