PURPOSE:
My goal is that these small programs develop into a python module that will allow easy and consistent     photometry. Still very much developing the idea...

STATUS:
makeColorCut.py, makeRadiusCut.py, and makeShapeCut.py are the functions I wrote for working with a specific data set. I'm starting working on
generalizing them so they can easily be included in larger programs and used for many different data sets. These updated functions are included in
the utils file
